1.	Prepare the image
	a. 	Open your image in GIMP
	b. 	File -> Export As
			filename: EXAMPLE.c
			Type    : "C source code"
		[Export]
			prefixed name: gimp_image
			Comment      : <any>
			[x] Use GLib types
			[ ] <<all other options>>
			Opacity      : 100%
		[Export]

2.	Prepare conversion tool [stored in (eg.) /path/]
	a.	cp  _convert*.*  /path/
	b.	cp  EXAMPLE.c    /path/

3.	Run the conversion tool
	a.	cd  /path/
	b.	./_convert.sh  EXAMPLE.c

4.	All being well, you will see an ascii version of your image.
	If not, then you're gonna have to submit a bug report <shrug>

5.	You should now have:
		img_EXAMPLE.c - The data for your image
		images.h      - A header for ALL images you have processed in this directory

6.	The show() function, which (optionally) decompresses, and 
	displays your image can be found in:  _convert_test.c

	The PLOT macro is whatever command you use to plot a pixel on the screen.
		On the FZ, this is TWO function calls:
			void  canvas_set_color(Canvas* canvas,  Color color) ;
			void  canvas_draw_dot (Canvas* canvas,  uint8_t x,  uint8_t y) ;
		There is an obvious optimisation: ONLY call set_color() when the colour changes!
